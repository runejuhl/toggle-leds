* toggle-leds
Toggle LEDs using triggers. Made for discrete notifications (e.g. while sitting
in a lecture hall at [[https://cfgmgmtcamp.eu][cfgmgmtcamp]] :).

** Usage
To blink the caps lock trigger on a ThinkPad when ~host.example.org~ responds to
ping requests:
#+begin_src bash
until ping -w2 -c1 -D host.example.org &>/dev/null; do
  echo -n .
  sleep 1
done && while sleep 0.5; do
  ./build/toggle-leds input4::capslock
done
#+end_src

In the above we send a single ICMP packet (~-c1~), exit after a deadline of 2
seconds (~-w2~) and use quiet mode (~-q~) and throw ~stdout~ and ~stderr~ away
(~&>/dev/null~). Until ~ping~ exits with an exit code of ~0~ we'll print a
single dot with no newline (~echo -n .~) and sleep 1 second (which also means
that we have an easier time killing the process if we want to cancel it).

When ~ping~ exits with ~0~ we'll toggle the ~input4::capslock~ LED every ~0.5~
seconds until terminated.

** Available LEDs
The available LEDs differ between platforms. On a ThinkPad A485 the following
are available:

#+begin_example
$ find /sys/class/leds/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -follow -exec basename {} \; | sort
input4::capslock
input4::numlock
input4::scrolllock
input8::capslock
input8::compose
input8::kana
input8::numlock
input8::scrolllock
phy0-led
platform::micmute
platform::mute
tpacpi::kbd_backlight
tpacpi::power
tpacpi::standby
tpacpi::thinklight
tpacpi::thinkvantage
#+end_example

Note that not all of these actually work; Lenovo sadly decided to do away with
the awesome ~thinklight~...

To show a list of LEDs on your platform, run the following command:
#+begin_src sh
find /sys/class/leds/ -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d -follow -exec basename {} \; |
  sort
#+end_src

** Notes
The binary needs read/write access to the ~brightness~ file and read access to
the ~max_brightness~ file for LED devices under ~/sys/class/leds/~ to work. The
~Makefile~ does this automatically, but for posterity this is the command you
need to run â€” ...but only if you understand what it actually does; ~setuid~ is
dangerous!

#+begin_src sh
setuid u+s ./build/toggle-leds
#+end_src
